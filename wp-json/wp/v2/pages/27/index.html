Existing implementations are not always available.<\/li>\n<li>The literature contains both comparisons between protocols only (software) and between complete solutions (platforms and protocols, i.e. hardware + software).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Our vision<\/h2>\n<p>The IoT Benchmark consortium built itself bottom-up, driven and pushed by the low-power wireless networking academic community. Our objective is to design a comprehensive benchmark not only consisting of problem sets, but also providing tools and methodologies for performance evaluation of low-power networking solutions.<\/p>\nTo feed the process, we have been interacting with other research communities already using benchmarking (robotics, database, etc.). Together, we co-organize\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/cpsbench2018.ethz.ch\/\">CPSBench 2018<\/a>, the 1st Workshop on Benchmarking Cyber-Physical Networks and Systems (satellite workshop of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cister.isep.ipp.pt\/cpsweek2018\/\">CPSWeek<\/a>).<br \/>\nDiscussions with various IoT companies also triggered a lot of interest: they face similar problems for evaluating their products and comparing with competitors.<br \/>\nA standardized benchmark is also called for by industry.\n<p>It is still not clear\u00a0however how strictly the benchmark problems should be defined. There is a fundamental trade-off between accuracy and generality in the benchmark design space.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.iotbench.ethz.ch\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/AccuracyGeneralityTradeoff.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"472\" height=\"220\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The more accurately benchmark problems are defined, the better for fair comparisons, but the less practical and usable the benchmark becomes.
